# EZIoT - Easy "Internet of Things" [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EZIoT/EZIoT.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EZIoT/EZIoT)

EZIoT is a UPnP based library for the ESP32 WiFi microcontroller chip from [Espressif Systems](https://www.espressif.com/).
 
***This library is currently in development and is not a fully working or complete library***

### Prerequisites

To use the library you will need either the Ardino IDE or PlatformIO with the ESP32 Arduino library installed. Full instructions can be found on the [Espressif Repo](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/README.md) page

### Installation

[Arduino IDE](docs/arduino.md)

[PlatformIO](docs/platformio.md)

## Testing

Use the [Universal Plug-and-Play Tester](http://noeld.com/programs.asp?cat=dstools#upnptest) for 
testing the interaction with the library running on the ESP32 boards.
